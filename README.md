## Overview

`wildrtrax` (pronounced *wild-r-tracks*) is an R package containing functions to help manage and analyze environmental sensor data. It helps to simplify the entire data life cycle by offering tools for data pre-processing, wrangling, and analysis, facilitating seamless data transfer to and from [WildTrax](https://wildtrax.ca/). With `wildrtrax`, users can effortlessly establish end-to-end workflows and ensure reproducibility in their analyses. By providing a consistent and organized framework, the package promotes transparency and integrity in research, making it effortless to share and replicate results.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `wildrtrax` directly from this repository with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax")
```

The [development](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/tree/development) version of this package contains experimental features and recent fixes. It can be installed with: 

```r
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax@development")
```

The development version of the package will be periodically merged and will be reflected in the [Changelogs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/news/index.html).

## Usage

All functions begin with a `wt_*` prefix. Column names and metadata align with the WildTrax infrastructure. The goal is to follow the work flow of pre-processing, linking with WildTrax, download and analysis.
