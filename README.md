## Overview

`wildrtrax` (pronounced *wild-r-tracks*) is an R package containing functions to help manage and analyze environmental sensor data. It helps to simplify the entire data life cycle by offering tools for data pre-processing, wrangling, and analysis, facilitating seamless data transfer to and from [WildTrax](https://wildtrax.ca/). With `wildrtrax`, users can effortlessly establish end-to-end workflows and ensure reproducibility in their analyses. By providing a consistent and organized framework, the package promotes transparency and integrity in research, making it effortless to share and replicate results.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `wildrtrax` directly from this repository with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax")
```

The [development](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/tree/development) version of this package contains experimental features and recent fixes. It can be installed with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax@development")
```

The development version of the package will be periodically merged and will be reflected in the [Changelogs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/news/index.html).

## Usage

All functions begin with a `wt_*` prefix. Column names and metadata align with the WildTrax infrastructure. The goal is to follow the work flow of pre-processing, linking with WildTrax, download and analysis.

### Acoustic work flow

Download data and run and a single-season single-species occupancy analysis. Consult [APIs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/apis.html) and [Acoustic data wrangling](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/acoustic-data-wrangling.html) for more information.

```R         
library(wildrtrax)
library(tidyverse)

# OAuth logins only. Google OAuth2 will be supported soon.
Sys.setenv(WT_USERNAME = "*****", WT_PASSWORD = "*****")

# Authenticate to WildTrax
wt_auth()

# Get a project id
projects <- wt_get_download_summary("ARU") |>
  filter(project == "ABMI Ecosystem Health 2023") |>
  select(project_id) |>
  pull()

# Download the main report
data <- map_dfr(.x = projects, .f = ~wt_download_report(.x, "ARU", weather_cols = F, reports = "main")

# Format to occupancy for OVEN
dat.occu <- wt_format_occupancy(my_report, species="OVEN", siteCovs=NULL)

# Run the model
mod <- unmarked::occu(~ 1 ~ 1, dat.occu)
mod
```

Conduct some pre-processing on various types of acoustic data. See more in [Acoustic pre-processing](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/acoustic-pre-processing.html). 

```R         
library(wildrtrax)
library(tidyverse)

# Scan files and filter results
files <- wt_audio_scanner(path = ".", file_type = "wav", extra_cols = T) |>
              mutate(hour = as.numeric(format(recording_date_time, "%H"))) |>
              filter(julian == 176, hour %in% c(4:8))
              
# Run acoustic indices and LDFCs
wt_run_ap(x = my_files, output_dir = paste0(root, 'ap_outputs'), path_to_ap = '/where/you/store/AP')

wt_glean_ap(my_files |>
    mutate(hour = as.numeric(format(recording_date_time, "%H"))) |>
    filter(between(julian,110,220), hour %in% c(0:3,22:23)), input_dir = ".../ap_outputs", purpose = "biotic")

```

### Camera work flow

The ultimate pipeline for your camera data work flows. See [Camera data wrangling](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/camera-data-wrangling.html) for more information.

```R         
library(wildrtrax)
library(tidyverse)

# OAuth logins only. Google OAuth2 will be supported soon.
Sys.setenv(WT_USERNAME = "*****", WT_PASSWORD = "*****")

# Authenticate to WildTrax
wt_auth()

# Get a project id
projects <- wt_get_download_summary("CAM") |>
  filter(project == "ABMI Ecosystem Health 2014") |>
  select(project_id) |>
  pull()

# Download the data
raw_data <- map_dfr(.x = projects, .f = ~wt_download_report(.x, "CAM", weather_cols = F, reports = "main")

# Summarise individual detections and calculate detections per day in long format
summarised <- wt_ind_detect(raw_data, 30, "minutes") |>
              wt_summarise_cam(raw_data, "day", "detections", "long")
```

### Ultrasonic work flow

Format tags from [Kaleidoscope]() for a WildTrax project. Download data from a project into an [NABAT]() acceptable format.

```R         
library(wildrtrax)
library(tidyverse)


```

### Point count work flow

Download combined and formatted acoustic and point count datasets together

```R         
library(wildrtrax)
library(tidyverse)


```
