## Overview

`wildrtrax` (pronounced *wild-r-tracks*) is an R package containing functions to help manage and analyze environmental sensor data. It helps to simplify the entire data life cycle by offering tools for data pre-processing, wrangling, and analysis, facilitating seamless data transfer to and from [WildTrax](https://wildtrax.ca/). With `wildrtrax`, users can effortlessly establish end-to-end workflows and ensure reproducibility in their analyses. By providing a consistent and organized framework, the package promotes transparency and integrity in research, making it effortless to share and replicate results.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `wildrtrax` directly from this repository with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax")
```

The [development](https://github.com/ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax/tree/development) version of this package contains experimental features and recent fixes. It can be installed with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/wildrtrax@development")
```

The development version of the package will be periodically merged and will be reflected in the [Changelogs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/news/index.html).

## Usage

All functions begin with a `wt_*` prefix. Column names and metadata align with the WildTrax infrastructure. The goal is to follow the work flow of pre-processing, linking with WildTrax, download and analysis.

### Acoustic work flow

Download data and run and a single-season single-species occupancy analysis. Consult [APIs](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/apis.html) and [Acoustic data wrangling](https://abbiodiversity.github.io/wildrtrax/articles/acoustic-data-wrangling.html) for more information.

```         
library(wildrtrax)

# OAuth tokens only. Google OAuth2 will be supported soon
Sys.setenv(WT_USERNAME = "*****", WT_PASSWORD = "*****")
       
wt_auth()

projects <- wt_get_download_summary("ARU") |>
  filter(project == "ABMI Ecosystem Health 2023") |>
  select(project_id) |>
  pull()

data <- map_dfr(.x = projects, .f = ~wt_download_report(.x, "ARU", weather_cols = F, reports = "main")

dat.occu <- wt_format_occupancy(my_report, species="OVEN", siteCovs=NULL)
mod <- unmarked::occu(~ 1 ~ 1, dat.occu)
mod
```

Conduct some pre-processing

### Camera work flow

```         
library(wildrtrax)

Sys.setenv(WT_USERNAME = "*****", WT_PASSWORD = "*****")

wt_auth()


projects <- wt_get_download_summary("CAM") |>
  filter(project == "ABMI Ecosystem Health 2014") |>
  select(project_id) |>
  pull()

raw_data <- map_dfr(.x = projects, .f = ~wt_download_report(.x, "CAM", weather_cols = F, reports = "main")

summarised <- wt_ind_detect(raw_data, 30, "minutes") |>
              wt_summarise_cam(raw_data, "day", "detections", "long")
```

### Ultrasonic work flow

Coming soon!

### Point count work flow

Coming soon!
